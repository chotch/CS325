Debriefing
1. This assignment took me about 4 hours.
2. Upon first looking at the assignment I anticipated that it would be difficult. However, after watching a few youtube videos on working through binary trees I would evaluate the homework as moderate.
3. I worked mostly on my own. I chatted with two peers through text messages to discuss approaches on how to work the problems.
4. I think I understand the material about 70-80%. I confidently understand the theory of how to work through the problems although am not super comfortable with coding them using recursion.
5. None
