   i - undirected, sparse, cyclic

1. a - the topological sort in the knapsack code is from lowest to highest value for each weight
   b - top down traverses in the opposite direction going from max weight to least weight
   c - yes, I assume there is also a top down solution which could maybe be done by looking at the end nodes and then traversing specific nodes based upon in-degree after that

4. I think I understand about 75%. Once again, the theory is quite easily understandable, but the coding gives me difficulties sometimes, which is very frustrating because I feel like I should be more equipped to do these problems and that they should be taking as long because of how well I understand it conceptually.
