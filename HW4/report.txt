1. a. To enumerate all pairs and then sort takes O(n^2)
   b. To enumerate all pairs and then use qselect takes O(nlogn)
   c. To enumerate 2n pairs using baby dijkstra takes O(n)
2. The time complexity of three way merge sort is O(nlog(3n)) which simplifies to O(nlogn).
3. The time complexity of k smallest using a heap is O(nlogk).
4. Optional (fill in later)

1. I spent about 30 minutes on the graded portion of the assignment and only about 30 minutes thinking about the other problems. I did not have time to implemenet most of the nongraded ones this week, but will ensure that I thoroughly look over solutions so that I understand them.
2. I would rate this homework as moderate. I really understand heaps well.
3. Mostly alone although I discussed the graded portion with Thomas Weathers briefly.
4. I understand about 70% of this homework assignment. I feel confident with any heap or ksmallest problems. Merge sort is still difficult to me and I have yet to truly understand dijkstras. 
5. I really like working with binary heaps and BSTs. They seem very intuitive, usefull, and unique and I think I am good at understanding the material present within them.
6. The part of the course I dislike the most is mergesort. I am having a tough time understanding the implementation provided in the homework solutions and I dont quite understand it conceptually either.
